Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) has high morbidity and mortality, disproportionately affecting rural patients despite adjusting for comorbidities. Inter-hospital transfers for rural patients cause delays in access to specialized care and are associated with adverse outcomes. Published prognostic tools lack distance as factor hence we explored training of three machine learning models to predict 30-day mortality, modified Rankin scale on discharge and discharge disposition in ICH patients using distance from home to tertiary care.
