With the wider availability of healthcare data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), more and more data-driven based approaches have been proposed to improve the quality-of-care delivery. Predictive modeling, which aims at building computational models for predicting clinical risk, is a popular research topic in healthcare analytics. However, concerns about privacy of healthcare data may hinder the development of effective predictive models that are generalizable because this often requires rich diverse data from multiple clinical institutions. Recently, federated learning (FL) has demonstrated promise in addressing this concern. However, data heterogeneity from different local participating sites may affect prediction performance of federated models. Due to acute kidney injury (AKI) and sepsisâ€™ high prevalence among patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), the early prediction of these conditions based on AI is an important topic in critical care medicine. In this study, we take AKI and sepsis onset risk prediction in ICU as two examples to explore the impact of data heterogeneity in the FL framework as well as compare performances across frameworks.
