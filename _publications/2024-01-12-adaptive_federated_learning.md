Clinical risk prediction with electronic health records (EHR) using machine learning has attracted lots of attentions in recent years, where one of the key challenges is how to protect data privacy. Federated learning (FL) provides a promising framework for building predictive models by leveraging the data from multiple institutions without sharing them. However, data distribution drift across different institutions greatly impacts the performance of FL. In this paper, an adaptive FL framework was proposed to address this challenge. Our framework separated the input features into stable, domain-specific, and conditional-irrelevant parts according to their relationships to clinical outcomes.
