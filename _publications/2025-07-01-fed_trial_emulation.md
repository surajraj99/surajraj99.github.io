Target trial emulation (TTE) aims to estimate treatment effects by simulating randomized controlled trials using real-world observational data. Applying TTE across distributed datasets shows great promise in improving generalizability and power but is always infeasible due to privacy and data-sharing constraints. Here we propose a Federated Learning-based TTE framework, FL-TTE, that enables TTE across multiple sites without sharing patient-level data. FL-TTE incorporates federated protocol design, federated inverse probability of treatment weighting, and a federated Cox proportional hazards model to estimate time-to-event outcomes across heterogeneous data. We validated FL-TTE by emulating Sepsis trials using eICU and MIMIC-IV data from 192 hospitals, and Alzheimerâ€™s trials using INSIGHT Network across five New York City health systems. FL-TTE produced less biased estimates than traditional meta-analysis methods when compared to pooled results and is theoretically supported. Our FL-TTE enables federated treatment effect estimation across distributed and heterogeneous data in a privacy-preserved way.
