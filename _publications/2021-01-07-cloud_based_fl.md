Building well-performing machine learning (ML) models in health care has always been exigent because of the data-sharing concerns, yet ML approaches often require larger training samples than is afforded by one institution. This paper explores several federated learning implementations by applying them in both a simulated environment and an actual implementation using electronic health record data from two academic medical centers on a Microsoft Azure Cloud Databricks platform.
