I am a Ph.D. student in the [Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Computational Biology](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) at Weill Cornell Medical College, specializing in computational biology and bioinformatics. My research interests include the impact of data heterogeneity in federated learning, predicting the ploidy status of embryos using deep video classification, clinical trial emulation, and deep learning in genomics. I am honored to be supported by the National Science Foundation through a Graduate Research Fellowship. Currently, I am co-mentored by [Dr. Fei Wang](https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/) and [Dr. Iman Hajirasouliha](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/hajirasouliha/lab/).

In the past, I have had the opportunity to work as a Bioinformatics Researcher at Wake Forest School of Medicine under the guidance of [Dr. Umit Topaloglu](https://datascience.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/umit-topaloglu). My projects there included the identification of immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAEs), predicting COVID-19 diagnosis using televisits and progress notes, and federated learning using cloud computing. I also worked on detecting smoking status using natural language processing.

During my undergraduate studies at Georgia Institute of Technology, I majored in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Computing and Intelligence. I was awarded the Presidentâ€™s Undergraduate Research Award (PURA) Fellowship.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the latest advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on society.

Outreach
======
In the past three years, I have been actively involved in various outreach activities. Since March 2023, I have been a Research Mentor at [Lumiere Education](https://www.lumiere-education.com/) in New York City, where I have mentored students on machine learning in healthcare. I have also led a team for the Dept. of Health & Humans Services Blood Donation Campaign from October 2022 to February 2023, where we developed a winning proposal for the "Giving=Living" campaign aimed at promoting blood donations to address shortages.  I have also led a team addressing inequities in academic recognition for disadvantaged groups from December 2021 to April 2022. We [proposed a policy](https://www.me.gatech.edu/news/team-epics-wins-student-innovation-competition-promoting-equity-access) to ensure that students with disabilities get academic recognition for completed courses at Georgia Tech, and presented our findings to the Georgia Tech College of Engineering Diversity & Inclusion Council.

GRFP Help
======
The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) has opened numerous doors for me, and I strongly urge all eligible individuals to consider applying. I'm more than willing to discuss the application process and provide insights based on my experience. If you're interested, I can also share my research and personal statement upon request.

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
