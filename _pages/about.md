About Me
-----
I am a Ph.D. student in the [Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Computational Biology](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) at Weill Cornell Medical College, specializing in computational biology and machine learning. My research interests include exploring multimodal methods for furthering women's health and in vitro fertilization (IVF), clinical trial emulation, natural language processing and modeling in medical data, as well as deep learning in genomics. I am honored to be supported by the National Science Foundation through a Graduate Research Fellowship. Currently, I am co-mentored by [Dr. Fei Wang](https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/) and [Dr. Iman Hajirasouliha](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/hajirasouliha/lab/).

In the past, I have had the opportunity to work as a Bioinformatics Researcher at Wake Forest School of Medicine under the guidance of [Dr. Umit Topaloglu](https://datascience.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/umit-topaloglu). My projects there included the identification of immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAEs), predicting COVID-19 diagnosis using televisits and progress notes, and federated learning using cloud computing.

During my undergraduate studies at Georgia Institute of Technology, I majored in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Computing and Intelligence. I was awarded the Presidentâ€™s Undergraduate Research Award (PURA) Fellowship.

Outreach
-----
I have been actively involved in various outreach activities. Since March 2023, I have been a Research Mentor at [Lumiere Education](https://www.lumiere-education.com/) in New York City, where I have mentored students on machine learning in healthcare. I have also led a team for the Dept. of Health & Humans Services Blood Donation Campaign from October 2022 to February 2023, where we developed a winning proposal for the "Giving=Living" campaign aimed at promoting blood donations to address shortages.  I have also led a team addressing inequities in academic recognition for disadvantaged groups from December 2021 to April 2022. We [proposed a policy](https://www.me.gatech.edu/news/team-epics-wins-student-innovation-competition-promoting-equity-access) to ensure that students with disabilities get academic recognition for completed courses at Georgia Tech, and presented our findings to the Georgia Tech College of Engineering Diversity & Inclusion Council.

GRFP Help
-----
The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) has opened numerous doors for me, and I strongly urge all eligible individuals to consider applying. I'm more than willing to discuss the application process and provide insights based on my experience. If you're interested, I can also share my research and personal statement upon request.
