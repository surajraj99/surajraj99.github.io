title: "Development of a Practical Arthritic Grip for Common Use"
excerpt: "Our project began as an investigation of difficulties that osteoarthritic patients may have in their daily lives and current solutions that attempt to solve those problems. We focused mainly on osteoarthritis (OA) in hands due to its prevalence in the elderly population. After several prototype iterations, we came up with a final design that greatly reduced to force needed to insert kitchen utensils and increased the number of compatible utensils."
